# Minetest_RPG

A RPG mod for Minetest

In the mod, each player has his own individual stats. There are three stats - Mining, Digging, and Axe. 
Mining Exp can be gained by just mining with a pickaxe.
Digging Exp can be gained by digging with a shovel.
And Axe Exp is gained by cutting trees with an axe.

When a player reaches level one in a stat, he unlocks that stat's skill.
The Mining Skill can change stone into a random ore.
Mining levels increase rarity of the ores and decrease the cooldown.
The Digging Skill can dig 3x3x3 areas of dirt, clay, sand, or gravel.
Digging levels decrease the cooldown.
The Axe Skill can cut an entire tree down.
Axe levels decrease the cooldown.

There is a HUD that shows all the stats and exp. 

There is also a test map included to show off features of the mod.
